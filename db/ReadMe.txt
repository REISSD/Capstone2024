Hey its me, Wang

The "db" folder has the sql for creating the database.
Reminder, you may have to drop the database if you already have on created
	To drop a database
	-	Go to an daatabase manager of your choice
	-	IF using MySQL workbench, connect to database, then right click the database, select 'drop scheme'
	-	IF using myPHPadmin, click on database to remove, go to 'Operations' using the tabs on top, select 'Drop the database(DROP)'
	-	LMK if you are using an manager that is not menton

If database Does Not Exist, you can import the tables THEN the data in the "datafolder"
	1 - Use the "CreateCapstone.sql" to make the tables
	2 -	The Data Should be in the table but if not follow below
	2 - 	* Import the data from the "datafolder", they are formatted as .sql
	2 - 	* Import the data from the "cvs", they are formatted as .cvs

LMK if there are any issue on discord Thanks
